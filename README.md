In this project I created a twitter clone.
The user is able to like and retweet a tweet or create his own tweet. Also the user can click on the reply icon and see the replies a tweet has.
To make this possible using data attributes was very useful. By using them I was able to pin down which tweet the user liked/retweeted etc.
Also i used CDNs to generate X a random UUID for the tweet the user posts himself and for the tweet icons I used.
To visually show when the user liked or retweeted a tweet I used conditionally styling.
